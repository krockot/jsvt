Simple javascript VT100 (subset) emulator.

Instantiate a new jsvt.Terminal() object and embed its .display property (a DOM object)
somewhere in your document.

Calling .Write(str) on the terminal will of course write to the display.

A substantial subset of ANSI control sequences are supported, including:

- SGR character attributes
- Switching between application and normal input modes
- Switching to an alternate screen buffer
- Cursor positioning
- Scroll regions
- Other commonly used terminal manipulation sequences

Also provided is an input translation mechanism that depends on jquery.keyboard.
This allows various control keypresses to be translated into appropriate input
sequences before being sent to e.g. a remote terminal device.

Simply call .InputString(e) where e is a jquery.keyboard event.  The appropriate
ANSI string to send will be returned.

Visual bell is also supported.  If the bell character ('\a' or '\x07') is written
to the terminal via Write(), the display element will invert for 200 milliseconds.

This implementation is sloooooooow and messy.  And quite functional.

A work in progress.
